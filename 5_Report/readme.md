## ULTRASONIC SOUND SENSOR WITH ATmega328 MICROPROCESSOR
The project as the name suggests is based on Ultrasonic sensors.Ultrasonic sensors work by sending out a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo. The sensor determines the distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the ultrasonic pulse.

## Introduction
An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object's proximity

## Defining Our System:-
Ultrasonic sensors work by sending out a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. The transducer of the sensor acts as a microphone to receive and send the ultrasonic sound. Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo

## SWOT ANALYSIS:-
## Strength:
The distance to an obstacle can be measured with the low cost ultrasonic sensor . The sensors can measure distances form 2 to 400cm with an accuracy of 3mm. This sensors module includes ultrasonic transmitter, ultrasonic receiver and control circuit.

## Weakness:
Although we fully believe in the capability of our sensors, we understand that ultrasonics are not suited for every application. Focuses of low thickness, similar to froth and fabric, have a tendency to assimilate sound vitality; these materials may be hard to sense at long range.

## Opportunity:
This project Can be used as parking assistance systems in vehicles with high power ultrasonic transmitter. This Project Can be used as burglar alarm with suitable additional software for homes and offices.

## Threats :
Ultrasonic sensors must view a surface (particularly a hard, level surface) unequivocally (oppositely) to get adequate sound reverberation. Additionally, solid detecting requires a base target surface range, which is indicated for every sensor sort. If connection is wrong there might be chances of short-circuit.
 
## Conclusion 
    The objective of the project was to design and implement an ultrasonic distance meter. The device described here can detect the target and calculate the distance of the target. The ultrasonic distance meter is a low cost, low a simple device for distance measurement. The device calculates the distance with suitable accuracy and resolution.
